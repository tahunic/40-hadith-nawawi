    "description": "Imam al-Nawawi begins the “Forty Hadith” with an introduction. Many times we are in the habit of skipping the introduction or quickly looking through introductions. This is a mistake, especially when studying Islamic sciences. We need to move on to a point where we actually know what we know and we can present it to others. This is important in being able to carry the dawah. In his introduction, Imam al-Nawawi is telling us essentially why he wrote this book, what got him to write this book and this is important in understanding the purpose of the work."

    "title": "Actions are by intentions",
    "description": "This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and undertanding and shows the balance between the internal and external states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is clear and the Haram is clear and between them are doubtful matters”(1), and “Whoever innovates in this religion that which is not from it will have all his actions rejected (by Allah).”(2)"
